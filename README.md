# keel-sklearn-csv
Some Keel Classification and Scikit-Learn Toy Datasets as CSV-Files 

## KEEL
This files are just versions of KEEL Repository data sets. They are transformed to CSV-Files.

Files within the onehot folders are One-Hot-Encoded (Dummy Encoded) versions. 
That means: Categorical Variables (Features) are expanded into Binary Variables. 
See for example the scikit-learn documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html
